# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

* docker

## Running the container

In order to start the development environment, run the env.sh script from anywhere inside the repo:
```
./environment/env.sh start
```

From inside the container, start the frontend or backend with their respective start.sh scripts or run both with utils/run.sh

## Running tests

### Frontend

### Backend

To run backend tests, while inside the container and in the folder `backend/` do

```
python3 -m unittest discover
```

## Random stuff here
